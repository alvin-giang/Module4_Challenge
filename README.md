### Summary

The primary objective of this report is to provide valuable insights to the school board and the mayor to aid them in making informed strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. This analysis focuses on area-wide standardized test results, specifically in Mathematics and Reading. By leveraging students' performance data in these subjects, along with comprehensive information about the schools they are enrolled in, I have aggregated the data and will highlight significant trends in school performance, offering a comprehensive view of the educational landscape and guiding discussions on key areas for improvement and investment

#### Local Government Area

The dataset comprises results from 15 local schools, encompassing a total student population of 39,170. Notably, the pass rates for Mathematics and Reading stand at 86.08% and 84.43%, respectively. In contrast, the percentage of students who successfully passed both subjects is marginally lower at 72.80%.

#### School Summary

In this section, I have computed various key metrics for each school, including total student count, total school budget, per-student budget, average scores in Mathematics and Reading, and the percentage of students who pass in each subject as well as both subjects.

The analysis reveals that Griffin High School emerges as the top-performing school, boasting an impressive overall passing rate of 81.36%. On the other hand, Hernandez High School is identified as the lowest-performing school, with a comparatively lower overall passing rate of 66.36%.

#### Score Summary

In this section, I have computed the average Mathematics and Reading scores of students based on their academic year, school spending, school size, and school type. This approach facilitates a comprehensive comparison of school performance across various dimensions, allowing for insights into how performance varies based on factors such as school size, spending levels, and school type. According to the findings, independent school show better performance in comparision with government school, with 76.97% overall passing and 70.70% overall passing respectively.
